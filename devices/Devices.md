bjt  bipolar because there are teo currenet.  Want to make tge base as thin as possible, as if itâ€™s not fully depleted, we want to avoid recombination so that IC ~ IE


fet. Mosfet or jfet. Unipolar.


all equations from circuits classes

  bjt vs mosfet

 majority carriers, wi thermall my insensitive (thermal generation and recombination are not so perfect, less noise)

high input impedance, low power

Smaller, simpler fabrication


Fet
JFET and MSFET, enhancement and depletion mode


Devices
BJT, FETS, photodiodes, caps, resistors, inductors
