# junctions

mos  metal isn’t usually used thoPolysilicon gates can bear high temperatures while metal gates can melt over that same temperature, so we can use the polysilicon gates as a self-alignment gate process during the fabrication of CMOS.
There’s no current flow, but the electric field can still modilate the bend across the oxide
Flat band, accumulation (e in n type), depletion (space charge), inversion (holes in N) states 


pn


ms junction. schottky barrier vs ohmic state. called a ohmic contact if metal wf is less than SC wf

pin


bjt  bipolar because there are teo currenet.  Want to make tge base as thin as possible, as if it’s not fully depleted, we want to avoid recombination so that IC ~ IE


fet. Mosfet or jfet. Unipolar.
