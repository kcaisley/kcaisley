## FTD Cleanroom Theoretical

#### (Thursday June 30th, 2022)

ISO classes - measured in maximum allowable air quality ppm, for different particle sizes, to prevent defects that can caused shorts, and reduce yield

Clean room is 360 m^2, with main space in ISO7, 3sub spaces with ISO6, and 1sub space w/ ISO5.

Clean-ness is achieved with air filters in the ceilings. The ISO5/6 rooms have laminar flow, with a subfloor which sucks air down.

Humidity must be below 42% with STD of +-1%

Lab parameters are your responsibility, if they would affect your processing (temperature, humidity, etc)



**Rules:**

* Always wear clean room clothing (boots, gloves, masks
* Visitors must be escorted by staff member (not student)
* Address alarms immediately
* Anything that will produce particles (pencils, paper, smoking, cell phones) is not allowed!
* All chemicals must be handled in a wet bench or exhausted enclosure
* Each chemical required authorization and training
* Open chemical containers cautiously -> point away from face/body in case of built up pressure
* Always Add Acid (ADD); never add water to acid
* When pouring chemicals, pour slowly to avoid splashes
* In most emergencies (fire, gas leak) immediately leave the clean room. In the case of getting chemicals in eyes or skin follow the process: 	clean w/ shower > call 112 for ambulance > get MSDS (E151) and give to responders > notify staff at FTD
* For spills, use Ph paper to test

**Rooms**

ISO 7 - General room

ISO 6 - Dry processing room (microstructuring, et)**?** Called the 'yellow lab' due to the light color

​	depositing ceramic layer, reactive ion etching, metrology tools

ISO 6 - Wet processing room (organic-organic, etc)**?**

ISO 5 - maskless aligner photolithogrphy, 



not sure where these are:

​	dicing tool for 300mm wafer

​	gemfor production, 'gem foils' or 'gen foils'?

What is backside processing?
