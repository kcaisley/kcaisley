# Sunday 29 January

Thinking about the sort of work that I want to do professionally, I've come to the following thoughts:

* I enjoy vanilla, simple technology and understanding those concept deeply. Deep tech doesn't exist in the world of SaaS and APIs. These B2B companies aren't truly producing and selling anything profoundlly innovative.
* The core infrastructures around us, be they water, electricity, gas, transportation (roads, bridges, railways, airports, shipping lanes), waste management, food, housing, and information system, represent core technologies, with deep meaningful impact on peoples lives. Changing these, both through regulation/laws and technological advancement is key to having a lasting impact on the world, and therefoe this is likely the area that I want to play in. "Boring" infrastructure isn't boring, it's amazingly powerful, important, and interesting.
* I want to build a employee-owned, debt-free, sustainable buisness. I don't have world domination plans. I want to be scrappy, see what can be done with less, and with older used technology.
* I'm not interesting in getting rich. I see companies and miniture corporations, and I think that each person at the company should make a similar salary, and only benefit make more if they world longer, or a later on in their career. Companies can never have zero-impact on the world around them, but this is fundementally because *people* can never have zero-impact on the world. We fundementally require energy inputs.
* Building a company that makes open source tools and then uses them to produce highly-documented, standardized, open source chips is the dream that I have. I want these chips to support the companies that are willing to open source their PDKs, and those that want to build open source end-user equipment that respects the users privacy and intelligence. The idea is that if you build a system with a open source hardware component, then you need to open source the hardware that you build with it. I'm still not sure if that's a good idea, but I think increasingly it is.
* I think if the chip design company is very transparent about what it's doing, and tells governments "hey, here is a reference design, you can buy from us, but if we ever go under, the revisions of the chip are public, and you can order future versions" then that is a big sell. Also, I think having really extreme transparency about our pricing is an wonderful idea, as it would allow people to see why a chip costs so much, which would help them stomach the cost of a more expensive device.
* Improved transparency and documentation will also allow system designers to understand how to properly repair and service their designs.
* My first step is to write circuit design software which can be user to create chips. I need it to somehow be both flexible and easy to use. Perhaps I can rewrite large portions of BAG in order to all it to simply run as a simple, single python module?
* Then I can essentially just use raw python immitating a domain specific language, with a back-end written in C++? The object oriented nature of C++ makes it ideal for modeling the design of electronic circuits, as they themselves are described as objects.

The environment here at Uni-Bonn is the perfect place to recieve financial support while pursuing this goal of building my tools. In fact, even after I graduate, I think I can add substantial value to the open source chip design environment by redesigning large portions of the chips needed for physics using these tools. Subtle improvements on these technologies, combined with strong inter-generational knowledge transfer as I reimplement these designs would be a boon for me to properly learn and succeed. Also the financial stability of working at Uni-Bonn is paramount, if I decide to have other interests outside of work. Finally, the pressure of the Uni-Bonn group needing to build real systems will force me to ultimately produce things of value, and keep me focused on making real world impacts.

I'm no longer in the phase of 'preparing for life'. This is my life now, and I want to live it in my desired manner, right now.
