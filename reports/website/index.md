I am a second-year PhD student working on mixed-signal integrated circuit design at the Research and Technology Center for Detector Physics ([FTD](https://www.ftd.uni-bonn.de/en/homepage?set_language=en)), University of Bonn, Germany.

My current research is focused on radiation-hard timing circuits - namely time-to-digital converters and clock generators. I am striving to conduct this work using automated design scripts to improve design speed, reuse, modification, and documentation.
