## Hello, I’m Kennedy

I am a second-year PhD student working on mixed-signal integrated circuit design at the Research and Technology Center for Detector Physics ([FTD](https://www.ftd.uni-bonn.de/en/homepage?set_language=en)), University of Bonn, Germany.

My current research is focused on radiation-hard timing circuits - namely time-to-digital converters and clock generators. I am striving to conduct this work using automated design scripts to improve design speed, reuse, modification, and documentation.

I want to explain first my research interests, and then talk about where I am. Work matters more than location...

Give github link?

The objective of my site is to emphasize the fact that I'm capable of building from the ground up, real chips. This is why my page is going to focus on the design of real chips.

On the left side, I want to show a micrograph of a real chip, and then to the right quote the process node, purpose, and contributors of the chip. I then will link against whatever repositories, papers, presentations, thesis, etc came out of the chip. Include code name, but at the end of the section.
