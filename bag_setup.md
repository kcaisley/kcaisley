# BAG Analog Generator

### Crossely ICCAD'13

* produce only **sized** schematic, the topology is up to the designer
* Good for:
  * technology characterization
  * schematic and testbench translation
  * simulator interfacing
  * physical verification and extraction
  * parameterized layout creation for common *styles *of layout. 
* BAG, in it's basic form belongs to the 'knowledge-based' design automation class, although specific sub-circuits area free to be optimized with some algorithm. This is especially useful with BAG, as we already have the ability to produce a high-quality subset of design to choose between.
* Knowledge-based design scripts are especially useful, as they self-document the design process. They also keep the designer 'in control' of the process.
* a completed BAG script helps with top level design, as you can specify the top level parameters, and then recursively instantiate the subblocks

"In our approach to analog circuit automation, a designer’s deliverable is not a single instance of a sized schematic and clean layout for a particular circuit, but rather a generator for a desired class of circuits that can replicate, in an automated fashion, the design procedure that would have been used for a traditional, manual design."

* Each realized circuit Generator much implement the methods of the interface
  * ReadSpecification()
  * DesignSchematic()
  * DesignLayout()
  * VerifyArchitecture()
  * WritePerformance()
* Because tasks are often the same between circuit generators though, there are abstract classes which provide connections to common actions in the design process, and to connect to tools.
  * CodeStubGeneration()
  * RunOptimizer()
  * LaunchSimulations()
  * RunDRCandLVS()
  * IO_OpenAccess()

I'm at the point in the tutorial where I've installed the necessary python packages, and now it's instructing me on how to set up the 'configuration file. But I don't understand where the Configuration file is?

Actually wait, it seems that I need to make these config files, and that they aren't BAG specific. I just need to 'point' to them from within the BAG database, so that BAG knows where they are?

env_file, lvs_runset, rcx_runset, and cell_map all appear to be files that are used normally for Cadence work.

Okay, so then the page with 'BAG Configuration File' listed must be listing items that I should interact with through the BAG interactive session?

Okay, so do I need to import python, and then try to import the BAG library?

I think I understand now; I need to load the bag2 code base from within python3, and use the `setup.py` and `__init__.py` file as my starting point for library import.

To install this module, I really want to use pip, but as I have multiple python version on the remote, I should launch pip from the anaconda python environment:

# Installing BAG Environment

Start by getting the latest version of Anaconda, using this page:
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-anaconda-on-centos-7/

This is the version of Anaconda I selected:
Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh

After anaconda was installed, I tried to setup the BAG3 code, but the source for the documentation didn't exist, so I also downloaded the BAG2 code, to try and generate the documentation. 

I got the following error trying to build the sphinx documentation:

`(base) bash-4.2$ make html`
`sphinx-build -b html -d build/doctrees   source build/html`
`Running Sphinx v4.4.0`
`making output directory... done`
`WARNING: sphinx_rtd_theme (< 0.3.0) found. It will not be available since Sphinx-6.0`
`
`
`Theme error:`
`no theme named 'sphinx_rtd_theme' found (missing theme.conf?)`
`make: *** [html] Error 2`
`
`
I think I could try installing this with pip, but because I'm relying on Anaconda for this installation, I searched for a method using anaconda.

https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sphinx_rtd_theme

To install this package with conda run one of the following:
conda install -c conda-forge sphinx_rtd_theme 

Rerunning 'make html' I get the following: (It looks like it worked?

Build finished. The HTML pages are in build/html.

the documentation is working! It looks like I will be using a lot of Git, so I figured it would be best if I just updated my version of git:
https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-latest-version-of-git-git-2-x-on-centos-7/

Getting ready:

* Update git version on asiclab008
* Configure easy ssh access with key authentication
* Building the documentation
* Mounting the remote drive as a SMB share, so that it's locally available on mac os (also considered StrongSync)





## Cadence Crashing Notes:

For Friday:

x Figure out if Cadence is actually crashing  (yes, it is!)
x test linux config, to find a way to not make it crash. (Just use IC618)

The current version of my redhat/centOS distribution can be checked via:
cat /etc/redhat-release

To check Cadence config:

/cadence/cadence/IC618/tools.lnx86/bin/checkSysConf IC6.1.8


output of this indicated that the following packages are needed:
sudo yum install 

	xorg-x11-fonts-ISO8859-1-75dpi
	redhat-lsb
	xorg-x11-server-Xvfb

Now everything is passing for IC618!

Let's examine our two startup scripts:

/faust/user/kcaisley/cadence/tsmc65/cdr/tsmc_crn65lp_1.7a_rd53b

	-starts with /bin/csh -f
	-setenv CDSDIR /cadence/cadence/IC617
	-finishes with 'virtuoso'

the other script is, completely:
	#!/bin/bash
	export DMC_RUN_DIR=$(pwd)
	export DMC_SOS_DIR=/faust/user/kcaisley/designs/dmc65
	/cadence/local/bin/tsmc_crn65lp_1.7a_rd53 &
examining this other nested script tsmc_crn65lp_1.7a_rd53
	
We want to create a new startup script for running with cadence, we will put it in our personal directories for now.

Changing the following lines:

setenv CDSDIR /cadence/cadence/IC617 -> setenv CDSDIR /cadence/cadence/IC618
virtuoso -> vituoso &

This works now, as long as I start it as an executable './script_name'


In hind sight, it looks like we might not have some support for IC617, including no ASSURA618 version.

Therefore, I should probably just use the startup script tsmc_crn65lp_1.7a_rd53, and call it from piotrs script, as this adds additional DMC-specific variables.

Nope, it just freezes when it starts, so I recopied the central script, made the two changes, and will work from there.

# Monday June 27 🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎

I'm at the point in the tutorial where I've installed the necessary python packages, and now it's instructing me on how to set up the 'configuration file. But I don't understand where the Configuration file is?

Actually wait, it seems that I need to make these config files, and that they aren't BAG specific. I just need to 'point' to them from within the BAG database, so that BAG knows where they are?

`env_file`, `lvs_runset`, `rcx_runset`, and `cell_map` all appear to be files that are used normally for Cadence work.

Okay, so then the page with 'BAG Configuration File' listed must be listing items that I should interact with through the BAG interactive session?

Okay, so do I need to import python, and then try to import the BAG library?

Found this online:

>  *Package* - A folder/directory that contains `__init__.py` file. *Module* - A valid python file with `.py` extension. *Distribution* - How one *package* relates to other *packages* and *modules*.

I think I understand now; I need to load the BAG3 code base from within Python3, and use the `setup.py` and `__init__.py` file as my starting point for library import.

To install this package, [I really want to use pip](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15724093/difference-between-python-setup-py-install-and-pip-install), but as I have multiple python version on the remote, I should launch pip from the anaconda python environment:

It still wasn't working, but it's because I had to target the directory explicitily, and not the `setup.py` file.

The [command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40392499/why-is-m-needed-for-python-m-pip-install) that appears to have finally worked for me is `python -m pip install /faust/user/kcaisley/bag3`

It's important to remember that a 'module' in Python is the name for any file ending in a .py extension.

It [appears](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1471994/what-is-setup-py) that I could have actually just ran `pip install .` while inside the bag3 directory. Oh well 💁🏼‍♂️



Mark helped me understand that it's better to use conda virtual environements. We built a python environement with

​	`conda create -n bag3 python=3.9.12`

​	`conda activate bag3`

And then we reinstalled our BAG3 package in this virtual environement with the following command, run in our `/faust/user/kcaisley/bag3` directory:

- `python setup.py develop`

My next task is to figure out how to edit the configuration options of BAG, and how to start using it in an environement like JupyterNotebooks.

It's obvious that the BAG environment is running as a sqlite database, and that we need to initialize that database to interact with it.




# Other BAG thoughts:

Make sure all packages are installed as listed in the BAG_framework documentation. The two needed, sqlitedict and openmdao are installed via pip, not anaconda, as they aren't on the conda repo (but are on Pypi repo)

lauch the setup.py file with "pip install .", while inside the folder. As stated online, it's better to avoid directly calling the setup.py file.

conda create --name bag

# August 28:

I need to make sure that I use BAG_framework as my directory name, and not just BAG.


Delete the /designs/demo_ffmpt/ file and start over, by remaking a new empty one.

First, start a new project repo with these steps:
https://github.com/ucb-art/cds_ff_mpt-bag3

Then start up cadence and jupyter notebook with steps at the end of:
https://github.com/ucb-art/BAG2_cds_ff_mpt/

(This may not be 100% accurate.)



# Workspace setup phase:

Several differnt things need to be modified:

* Consult the bag2 ffmpt library to look at the configuration for Jupyter that is read in, before starting
  * `ipython_config.py` is stored inside the `.ipython\profile_default` directory. The bag3 ffmpt library was only the primitives directory on the lower level, but it does contain this file at `../../cds_ff_mpt/workspace_setup/ipython_config.py`. But the bag3 ffmpt library didn't have the xbase 
* the `ipython_config.py` file call

* `bag_config.yaml`
* `bag_submodules.yaml`
* `ipython_config.py`
* `leBindKeys`


## Needed changes:

In `./cds_ff_mpt/workspace_setup/ipython_config.py`, needed to a

```
## List of files to run at IPython startup.
c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_files = [
    os.path.join(os.environ['BAG_WORK_DIR'], 'bag_startup.py'),
]
```

This then calls `./bag_startup.py`, which I had to create, as is design specific to let Jupyter Notebook/Python know where to look. It's contents was:

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import os
import sys

sys.path.append(os.environ['BAG_FRAMEWORK'])
sys.path.append(os.environ['BAG_TECH_CONFIG_DIR'])
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.environ['BAG_WORK_DIR'], 'BAG2_TEMPLATES_EC'))
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.environ['BAG_WORK_DIR'], 'BAG_XBase_demo'))
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.environ['BAG_WORK_DIR'], 'bag_advanced_examples'))
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.environ['BAG_WORK_DIR'], 'bag_testbenches'))
```

This, of course, then leads me to consider if I have all the necessary project files mentioned above put in place.
[x] BAG_FRAMEWORK (bag code base)
[x] BAG_TECH_CONFIG_DIR (BAG PDK primitives folder, containing PDK softlink, among other things)
[X] BAG2_TEMPLATES_EC ... had to grab this online, added via simple git clone: https://github.com/ucb-art/BAG2_TEMPLATES_EC.git
[X] BAG_XBase_demo.... https://github.com/ucb-art/BAG_XBase_demo/tree/master
[X] bag_advanced_examples... same, had to clone from https://github.com/ucb-art/bag_advanced_examples.git
[X] bag_testbenches... yep, got from https://github.com/ucb-art/bag_testbenches.git

This completed now, but I still have unanswered questions about several other files. Explaining everything below:

## Chronological origin of files in top level directory, during installation:
Following steps from: https://github.com/ucb-art/cds_ff_mpt-bag3

#### Manually making new git repo, and adding git modules, and updating them

BAG_framework           manually git moduled from my local copy

cds_ff_mpt-bag3         manually git moduled from local copy (this is primitives tech repo)

.gitmodules

.git

#### Running install.sh in workspace directory (many of these files had to be prepared)

`bag_submodules.yaml` copied from worksapce setup, via install.sh

`.cdsenv.personal` copied from worksapce setup, via install.sh

`.cdsinit.personal` copied from worksapce setup, via install.sh

`bag_config.yaml` link from workspace setup, via install.sh, multipurpose config file, used by `setup_submodules.py` during installation, and during BAG runtime.

`.bashrc` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`.bashrc_bag` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`.cdsenv` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`.cdsinit` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`cds.lib.core` link from workspace setup, via install.sh, included by `cds.lib` on startup

`.cshrc` link from workspace setup, via install.sh, unused

`.cshrc_bag` link from workspace setup, via install.sh, unused

`display.drf` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`.gitignore` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`models` link from workspace setup, via install.sh (is a directory)

`pvtech.lib` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`leBindKeys.il` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`start_tutorial.sh` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`tutorial_files` link from workspace setup, via install.sh

`.ipython` created by install.sh (is a diretory, which contains ipython_config.py, which in turn is a link from workspace setup, via install.sh)

`gen_libs` created by install.sh

`cds.lib` created by install.sh (just points to cds.lib.core, which in turn points to )

`run_bag.sh` link from BAG framework, via install.sh, core script which actually runs BAG, called from core BAG scripts.

`setup_submodules.py` link from BAG framework, via install.sh, executed in the next step to actually 

`start_bag.il` link from BAG framework, via install.sh, written in SKILL, seems to call `virt_server.sh`, which in turn starts stuff in framework.

start_bag.sh link from BAG framework, via install.sh, very similar to `run_bag.sh` but appears unused

`virt_server.sh` link from BAG framework, via install.sh, called by `start_bag.il`, contains 1-line command to start server in BAG framework.

#### Running setup_submodules.py, which references bag_modules.yaml, both copied/link in the step above.

bag3_analog             automatic git module added by setup_submodules.py, from bag_modules.yaml

bag3_digital            automatic git module added by setup_submodules.py, from bag_modules.yaml

xbase                   automatic git module added by setup_submodules.py, from bag_modules.yaml

.bashrc_pypath          created by `setup_submodules.py`; contains `PYTHONPATH` env var python copies to sys.path on startup. Later exported by `run_bag.sh` and `start_bag.sh`.

bag_libs.def            created by `setup_submodules.py` with plaintext list of OA BAG libraries.

cds.lib.bag             created by `setup_submodules.py`, and included by cds.lib.core, which in turn is included by cds.lib.core

#### This finishes all the general BAG3 workspace setup, but for the tutorial, more was needed:

Following steps at at https://github.com/ucb-art/BAG2_cds_ff_mpt/

`BAG2_TEMPLATES_EC` manually git cloned from Github

`bag_advanced_examples` manually git cloned from Github

`bag_testbenches` manually git cloned from Github

`BAG_XBase_demo` manually git cloned from Github

`bag_startup.py` manually created, and made ipython_config.py call it, based on BAG2 example, adding libraries to pythonpath

#### Finally, starting up Virtuso

0. conda activate bag
1. source .bashrc
2. virtuoso &
3. ./start_tutorial.sh     this starts up iPython/Jupyter, which in turn calls the `.ipython/ipython_config` file, which then calls bag_startup.py

libManager.log          Log file created by Cadence Virtuoso on each startup.

## PYTHONPATH and sys.path understanding:
https://www.devdungeon.com/content/python-import-syspath-and-pythonpath-tutorial

## Changes to accomodate:
* renamed ~/eda/ to ~/packages/. Best to check for issues
* moved demo_ffmpt folder to ~/cadence/ folder, rather than /designs/. Check for issues.
* moved cds_ff_mpt-bag3 to ~/packages/ from ~/cadence/
* moved cds_ff_mpt_v_1.1 to ~/packages/ from ~/cadence/			so had to update PDK symlink.

## Potential outstanding problems:
* My reference to the cds_ff_mpd-bag module is broken in git, as it's still looking for an origin master in ~/cadence/. See above, as it's moved to ~/packages/
  * As a solution for now, I've just deleted the remote reference. It shouldn't really matter, as this is the only project I'll need which will use this cds_ff_mpt PDK
* Is anything calling `.bashrc_pypath`? I know `run_bag.sh` exports it; but I don't see the latter running anytime?
* Will the Jupyter notebook embedded in VScode read my `.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py` file on startup, like a standard Jupyter notebook would?


I may just delete all references to git, and move on with my life in this set of modules.

I need Jupyter to know where all my files are. Opening a Jupyter notebook in vscode will allow me to select a Anaconda environment, but it doesn't easily let me run the .ipython file, which calls the `bag_startup.py` to append to my

Once my Jupyter notebook in started in vscode, I can't simply call bash scripts to modify the environment variables. Plus, the sys.path has already been initialized by the integrated ipykernel upon startup, and no more interaction with the environement variable ipython

Jupyter comes with various components. The notebook server is language agnostic, and servers as the front end. iPython is a terminal only front end, which isn't used if I'm using the GUI jupyter notebook. The kernel is used by both, but is language specific.

I need to understand the difference between the notebook server and the jupyter kernel. It seems the kernel is what needs to be associated with my anaconda env, and not the notebook server?? These are shown in two different places, Kernel in the top left, and server in the bottom right.

I want to server to be started in a way that it is concious of all the environement variables I export when also starting cadence.

I think part of the problem I was facing before was that the local jupyter server was starting with it's home following the jupyter notebook symlink. And so this causes problems, becuase I

My virtual env setup is really confusing the hell out of me. I decided to strip out Anaconda and just use Python -m venv.
This can can't cross versions though, and so I need to install the latest version of python on my machine, 3.10, as i only have 3.6 as the system python....
Actually, I tried following this tutorial: https://linuxstans.com/how-to-install-python-centos/    but it didn't work

A method that seemed to work istead was to create a local install of python:
https://codeghar.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/install-python-3-locally-under-home-directory-in-centos-6-4/

This works. `which python3.10` points in my PATH.

Except now, the version of OpenSSL that I have doesn't work with Python3.10, and so I need to instead install python 3.9.14 with this method.

Creating a venv: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

activating a venv: source venv/bin/activate

installing packages: pip install -r ./requirements.txt

for some reason, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and m5py needed to be installed manually, as they were needing compiling and crashing if included in the above file.

This all works now though, in my new venv.

No I'm going to copy over the bag version, and see if I can get this sorted out, with the pybag.core problem.

I tried installing the packages pybind11, into pybind_generics, into pybag into bag, in that order, but I started hitting compile errors about Cmake. My Cmake version is okay, but apparently GCC was also outdated:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47238577/target-requires-the-language-dialect-cxx17-with-compiler-extensions-but-cma

However, at the bottom of this document, it points out that Centos has a package called devtoolset-7. By checking the command 'scl -l' I found that I already have this package. Running 'scl enable devtoolset-7 bash' was enough to get the gcc version updated! I think it just applies to the current terminal though. This is explained here:

## Thursday 15 September
How can I deal with installing Pybag? Is it a wheel package?

## Friday 16 Sep
I inspected the logs from running `pip install -e .` and found complaints about the packages `fmt` and `spdlog` being missing. I installed the two of these from yum, and tried to proceed. CMake has stopped complaining about fmt, but still is asking for spdlog to be located.

A useful command for searching all files for some text: `grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'` ... For example: `grep -rnw '.' -e 'CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH'`

Cleaned out my venv folder once again, and tried to follow the instructions [from yrrapt](https://github.com/yrrapt/bag/tree/develop)

I've recloned the bag3 develop branch on two separate machines, one with CentOS 7.9 and the other with Ubuntu 20.04. On each, I built a fresh python venv, and tried compiling the bag and pybag modules. In each case, the bag modules built properly, but the sub-module pybag is problematic. I've tried to read the CMakeLists.txt and follow the error build.log, to find clues about what packages might be missing or variables not configured, but no luck so far. My machines have the following:

* CentOS 7.9
* Python 3.9.14 (built from source)
* CMake 3.17.5
* fmt 8.22
* Boost 1.53.0
* gcc 7.3.1

* Ubuntu 20.04
* Python 3.8.10
* CMake 3.16.3
* fmt 8.30
* Boost 1.71.0
* gcc 9.4.0

Running `python -m pip install .` , I'm seeing build logs that contain the error below.

## After, Installed CMake with apt, wheel with pip, sudo apt install libboost1.71-all-dev, but still got:
```
  ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1:

      Add the installation prefix of "fmt" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "fmt_DIR"
      to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "fmt" provides a
      separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
```

I think I need to point CMake toward my fmt and spdlog installs. Will investigate further.


## Some quick notes on setting ENV variables:

To set variable only for current shell:
`VARNAME="my value"`

To set it for current shell and all processes started from current shell:

## To get libfmt:

find_package did not find the CMake package of fmt. It comes with the -dev variant of fmt's Ubuntu package. If you check the CI code, it installs libfmt-dev via apt:

`sudo apt install libfmt-dev`

Now it's pretty clear that I need the .cmake file from this package, and to figure out where it is I can use:

`dpkg -L libfmt-dev`

Yes! Now I can just get this file:

`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/fmt/fmt-config.cmake`

I'm not sure what 'depth' I have to point it at, but I will try all the way to /fmt. (I was right)

Looks like I will also be missing spdlog, so I will installed the development flavor with:

`sudo apt install libspdlog-dev`
`dpkg -L libspdlog-dev` which gives: `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/spdlog/spdlogConfig.cmake`

Will point at this below


## Let's try it with yrrapt's official repo, just making sure we enable OA:

* From inside `bag` dir `python3.9 -m venv ~/designs/bag3_pll_verfication/venv`
* `source venv/bin/activate`
* `vim pybag/setup.cfg` and deleted line `openaccess-disable = True` so that it could build with open access
* `export PYBAG_PYTHON=$HOME/temp/bag/venv/bin/python`

Nope, still errors:

## Sunday 18 Sep
* I really want to apply for this competition: https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-ose-code-a-chip.github.io
* Its submission deadline is November 21, which would give me a perfect outlet for completing a functioning Jupyter notebook in a reasonable amount of time. I've already been here for 133 days, and I feel as though I haven't accomplished anything. For now though, don't tell Hans about this conference.
* I want to learn how to use BAG, because OpenFASOC isn't really meant to work with analog chip design. The issue is that BAG3 doesn't support open source tools, and that access for the necessary OpenAccess library is apparently very difficult to get anyways.
* I want to use BAG3, as BAG2 is not going to be further developed. My main question then is what are the major differences between the two? I'm meeting with Thomas tomorrow, and he seems to understand the better the status of BAG.
* So what if I did the following.... built a generator which is able to produce a functioning VCO layout.. or even PLL, and do it in a way that uses the toolchain of BAG3? If I accomplished this, I would be the first person to successfully use BAG3 outside of Berkeley. Other papers, few of which exist, have used BAG2 only.
* The issue now, is that I'm not sure if I can really build a functioning tool chain with BAG3. It doesn't support open source tools yet, and getting it to even work with Cadence seems nigh impossible for those outside Berkeley/BlueCheetah. I should confirm this by reading papers, tomorrow, of course. I think I can get through a lot of material by the time I meet with Thomas Parry at 3pm.
* One thing I'm realizing though is that a lot of the design process doesn't really require me to have a function BAG installation. XBase seems like it is very tied to BAG, but I think LayGO2 is less BAG-centric? I should really check with JD Han to figure out how I'm expected to produce a layout in 65nm if I don't have this special Cadence OpenAccess library. Perhaps I can w
* Mirjana is a member of the committee which decides the winners of the code-a-chip competition, and so if I were to develop a notebook with her guidance, then there is a *very* good chance of being accepted.
* Another note, I should consider giving a group presentation on Sep 29th, because I told Hans that I would. Maybe I should break this promise though. I should explain to Hans that understanding the status of all this open source code has taken significantly more time than I anticipated. Explain that I've made connections with two important people though!
* If I don't use BAG, then how do I work with the schematics needed to compare against LayGO layouts during LVS?
* If I want to design a process portable generator, do I target the layout constraints of a small-fill factor 28nm design, and then expect it to scale to a 65nm, or even 130nm process? I think this makes more sense, as there are less degrees of freedom in 28nm.
* Can this tool (LayGO2) be used in isolation, without BAG?  I think it can!
* One thing that is amazing about this, is that Laygo is written entirely in Python, and so I shouldn't have any huge problems getting it to run. No compilation required, etc. It's a 1-way path for generation.
* Also, much of the design work 'back of the envelope work' can be done in Python scripts, without any circuit simulation at all. But, then, once I get to circuit simulation, I wonder if I am able to run parasitic extraction with Magic on open source Tools on 65nm? If think seems to work well, then I think I can trust it enough to do large cell design without re-running a DRC/LVS ruleset in Calibrew. To be double sure, I can simply run a final Parasitic extraction and DRC and LVS test against Cadence.
* There's also no reason why my schematics would necessarily need to be be designed in cadence source tools, right? If I am looking for process portability though, I think that I need to use something like BAG, where I am am able to make schematic and test bench generators.
* So one question is: If I'm not using BAG... how do I achieve process portability in my schematics, such that I can quickly compare them against laygo? I think that the basic Laygo workflow uses hand-crafted primitives, which aren't process agnostic. On the other hand, I think that Lay
* I can slowly replace every part of the 65nm workflow in Cadence, with equivalents in 65nm technology.

* To place transistors, you first specify the tile you are placing in, and then use XY coordinate (e.g.) within the tile. It defaults to position 0 for X and Y.
* BAG2 only supports ADEXL. BAG3 doesn't support any ADE package, Assembler, XL, or otherwise. Design variables are returned, but Stimuli and Data post processing must be done in Python, as we are just directly  calling Spectre.
* Notice how all the BAG developers are also using BAG to build real circuits, meaning they have real design cases.

#### Recap:
To be honest I have not produce much at all, but it hasn't been for lack of trying or time invested. It turns out that this is way harder than I thought.
I've worked on:

* Python package management
* Review of OOP programming in Python (To understand BAG codebase)
* Jupyter Notebook Usage and Server Setup
* CMake, Make, and other build related tooling (for building Python, BAG, PyBAG, XBase, etc)
* Tools are 'complete' but not distributed in a complete form, so they have to be built

One thing that is a bit annoying is that I have several different places where I could develop my code. I think to submit to CAC23 I need to have a GitHub repo.
My personal Github account (kottenforst, or kennedycaisley, or kcaisley?)

Things to understand from Hans:
Can the models of TSMC65 be using in ngSPICE?

Can LayGO2 be used without BAG? 

I think that the goal of the MOSAIC group is to modify the BAG3 codebase such that it can be used with open source tools like Xschem/Magic/Klayout. This is different from the goals of my group.

My goal of my meeting with Mirjana is to figure out where my design work can overlap with the interests of MOSAIC. I don't have the time and the energy and 


You can use BAG3 for Measurements, without needing to have the openaccess library tooling. I think that I should maybe start here, and build a BAG3 test bench for my PLL is 65 nm.

Skill is signifigantly slower than OA, but Mario Weiss also pointed out that GDS based generation is available in BAG2/BAG3. Some flows work without Virtuoso, but some functions require OA layout.

In git, what is main, origin, HEAD, 


origin is the default name given to the remote repository that a local repository is tied to. One can change this name, and can also add two different remotes to pull changes from. This is why we need aliases for remote repositories, so that we can distinguish between two remote codebases that are often nearly identical.

Hi Thomas and Mirjana,

After discussing with my co-workers + advisor, we've decided we want to identify and try acquiring, through official channels, the OpenAccess library used by BAG3 to interact with Virtuoso schematic and layout cellviews. If we succeed, we will document the steps we took to acquire the package, and share that knowledge with other groups. For those lacking the time or connections to acquire the dependency themselves, we would also be willing to take on the mantle of regularly compiling and distributing BAG3 with pybag/cbag binaries built against the OpenAccess component. Assuming it's legally allowed, I wonder if this would be useful for the subset of people primarily interested in just being users of BAG3 with Cadence.
As the above step could take considerable time with NDAs, in parallel, I want to figure out if the component of BAG3 responsible for launching SPECTRE/SPICE simulations and returning the results is able to be used without the OpenAccess component. If so, I will compile a version of BAG with this reduced-functionality. Assuming I manage to make this work, I want to then use this for a project:

My group invested significant time (4 revisions) designing this ^ 65nm clock-data recovery circuit for high radiation environments (total ionizing dose >1 Grad). The original design was done with a traditional industry workflow (Cadence Virtuoso, Calibre DRC/LVS/PEX, ADE XL testbenches, Spectre Simulation). Now that we have a silicon-verified design, though, we'd like to record that design knowledge in a BAG3 script for better documentation, modifications, and porting. Assuming BAG3's simulation component can be used as-in, I am going to start by re-implementing our verification framework for the PLL with the BAG3 API, and open source it.






# To Do

## Backlog

- [ ] Generate pre and post-extracted netlist of 65nm VCO
- [ ] Create a basic simulation of inverter, using tradition GUI Virtuoso Schematic/Layout -> PEX Extraction -> ADE XL -> Spectre -> ADE XL viewer.
- [ ] Reproduce basic INV simulation with SPICE netlist -> SPECTRE Command Line -> Flat File Output
- [ ] Reproduce basic INV simulation with: SPICE netlist -> Jupyter Notebook -> BAG3 -> SPECTRE -> BAG3 -> Jupyter Notebook.
- [ ] Start assembling list of tests to run on VCO.

## In Progress
- [ ] Identify what OpenAccess library is needed to properly compile and operate BAG3 (make issue of this)
- [ ] Move my venv over from my other venv, or just re-setup
- [ ] Figure out the ask to Ayan Biswas, Thomas Parry, or Marjana, to try and figure out exactly 'what' OpenAccess library is missing.

A decorator '@' is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate. They support operations such as being passed as an argument, returned from a function, modified, and assigned to a variable. This is a fundamental concept to understand before we delve into creating Python decorators.
This tutorial explains it best: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/decorators-python

But it looks like we would never call these latter two components, as they are lower level. Inside of the Spectre.py function, the 

# OpenAccess Dependency Research
A static library format for OA would require the rest of BAG be built with the the same version of build tools as it. Build tools are availabe from the CentOS software collections, in particular the devtoolset-7 through devltoolset-11 packages. These can be installed from yum, and examined with:

`sudo yum list devtoolset\*`

As each component is also available as it's own package, we can examine package contents via:

`sudo yum list devtoolset-8\*`

You can get started in three easy steps:

1. Install a package with repository for your system:
On CentOS, install package centos-release-scl available in CentOS repository:
$ sudo yum install centos-release-scl

On RHEL, enable RHSCL repository for you system:
$ sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms

2. Install the collection:
$ sudo yum install devtoolset-8

3. Start using software collections:
$ scl enable devtoolset-8 bash

At this point you should be able to use gcc and other tools just as a normal application. See examples below:

$ gcc hello.c
$ sudo yum install devtoolset-8-valgrind
$ valgrind ./a.out
$ gdb ./a.out

As Ayan points out, his .bashrc points to the locations of the various libraries. I notice that the version of OA is 22.60, which appears to be built against GCC 8.3, which is contained in devtoolset-8.

It looks like OA 22.60 is maybe the most recent version? https://si2.org/tag/oa-22-60/. In either case, it's obvious that the version matters.


## NEXT STEPS
Contact Thomas first thing, share what I learned from Ayan, including imports in .bashrc, and what version of GCC is necessary, and version of OA.
Next read the 6-7 tabs I have open about building from C++...

### Executables, Libaries, etc

Both libraries and executables are compiled non-human readable binaries, but the difference is that an executable will be intended to be used by itself and have a defined starting point, whereas code compiled as a library will have multiple extry points, and will be intended to be used as part of a larger project.

When linking in a library, whether or not is static vs dynamic matters. In either case though, code described as 'libraries' are not executible on their own.![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/537/1*QI-LJC2bVLwDMT9VTpnjtg.png)

A static library .a (or .lib on windows) is combined with compiled .c or .cpp machine .o in a process called linking (ld program), to produce an executible file with an .out (or .exe, on windows) extension.

Static libraries increase the size of the code in your binary. They're always loaded and whatever version of the code you compiled with is the version of the code that will run.

Dynamic libraries, with a .so (or .dll extension on Windows) are stored and versioned separately. It's possible for a version of the dynamic library to be loaded that wasn't the original one that shipped with your code **if** the update is considered binary compatible with the original version.

Additionally dynamic libraries aren't necessarily loaded -- they're usually loaded when first called -- and can be shared among components that use the same library (multiple data loads, one code load).

Dynamic libraries were considered to be the better approach most of the time, but originally they had a major flaw (google DLL hell), which has all but been eliminated by more recent Windows OSes (Windows XP in particular)



## Work in November

The OA binary libraries (.so) we have are for OA versions as recent as 22.60. In some instances we have their matching header (.h) files. But they have been compiled with GCC 4.4.x or older (probably corresponding to RHEL6).

Our use case for these libraries is to link to them in from some C++17 source code. 



Here is a link which talks about if it's possible to link in libraries that were built with a different version of GCC/ C++

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46746878/is-it-safe-to-link-c17-c14-and-c11-objects

### Response from Ayan:
Hello Kennedy,

The oa_v22.60.s007 is available in the Cadence Virtuoso library (IC618 or ICADVM181 or ICADVM201), as you mentioned. But BAG3 also requires the OA C++ libraries compiled for the OS (RHEL7) and C++ compiler (gcc 8) as you can see on lines 34-36 of the .bashrc that you linked. We were hoping to get the updated version of those libraries (raw or compiled). But it looks like you hit the same problems as us while trying to work out the deal with Si2.

Some researchers in our group are trying to figure out ways to remove the OA dependence, or understand it a bit better by reading the available code base, in an effort to make BAG3 truly "open source" and accessible by people outside BWRC. I will let you know if those attempts converge to an acceptable solution. 

### Message from me:
This does match the stance on Si2's website, which says only "a license-keyed binary version is available for research and teaching purposes."

What new version of the OA C++ libraries are you trying to acquire? I see a reference to oa_v22.60.s007 in your workspace setup .bashrc file, and my understanding is OpenAccess 22.60 (DM6) is the latest release.

As an aside, do you know if the OA API dynamic library .so files included in the standard Cadence Virtuoso install (at ../IC618/tools.lnx86/lib/64bit/  and ../IC618/oa_v22.60.063/lib/linux_rhel60_64/opt) are essentially what we'd have by building C++ source or getting the binary library from Si2? The directories don't include associated header files or exact compiler toolchain, but the file names do match the target link library references in BAG3's CBAG CMakeLists.txt file.

I think the header files from the different versions (except the 2.x) are very similar. I just briefly checked a few and they only differ in adding an overloaded function here and there or changes to the include list. They might work for a wide range of lib versions.

setup.cfg is a config file, which is read in by setup.py and contains infor that setup.py otherwise could. (Setup.py is a replacement for setuptools, as it is being deprecated)
config files like these oftentime also have the .ini file type or the the .conf file type.

### Reading setup.py and both CMakeLists.txt files

1. at bottom of setup.py, setup() function starts process, ext_modules and cmdclass looks to be important

setup.py is a older and more featured setup script, and setup.cfg and pyproject.toml are newer versions that are simpler and recommended unless you need the features of the older project.
Setuptools can build C/C++ extension modules. The keyword argument ext_modules of setup() should be a list of instances of the setuptools.Extension class.

So set the `ext_modules` keyword and inherit this class from the setuptools.Extension class, where we set a 

```
class CMakePyBind11Extension(Extension):
    def __init__(self, name, sourcedir=''):
        Extension.__init__(self, name, sources=[])
        self.sourcedir = str(Path(sourcedir).resolve())

setup(
  package_dir{'': 'src'},     // fed to the ext_modules command below, as a base direcotory for extensions
  ext_modules=[CMakePyBind11Extension('all')],     // this lists the specifics of extensions what is to be built
  cmdclass={'build_ext': CMakePyBind11Build},   // this actually runs the build extension operation

)
```

Inside the CmakePyBind11Build object, there is a method called `build_extension`, which:

1. calculates output directory for the build
2. init cmake command w/: build source dir, temp build dir, output dir, build type, optional compiler launcher settings
3. build cmake command
4. run ./gen_stubs.sh


## Running setup.py in pybag library
"pip install ."

But build.sh appears to not follow this logic

Instead, run build.sh:

```
# this script builds the C++ extension

if [ -z ${OA_LINK_DIR+x} ]
then
    echo "OA_LINK_DIR is unset"
    exit 1
fi

if [ -z ${PYBAG_PYTHON+x} ]
then
    echo "PYBAG_PYTHON is unset"
    exit 1
fi

${PYBAG_PYTHON} setup.py build
```

The `if [ -z ${VAR} ]` command evaluates to true if VAR is null, which is what the -z does.

as [ ] is short for the `test` command in bash

the `${...}` construct is parameter expansion

Ah shit, it looks like this `+x` nonsense was deprecated as of Bash v4.3, which is why this isn't working. Let's just run `setup.py build` directly.



Therefore, it's obvious that we need `OA_LINK_DIR` and `PYBAG_PYTHON`

```
export PYBAG_PYTHON=.... /bin/python3

CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH used by CMake, and is set to fmt,Boost,yamp-cpp, spdlog directories. It normally set at a high level by the output tool in .bashrc files of BAG project.

OA_INCLUDE_DIR  used in cbag CMakeLists.txt, set in .bashrc
OA_LINK_DIR     used in cbag CMakeLists.txt, set in .bashrc

export OA_LINK_DIR=${OA_SRC_ROOT}/lib/linux_rhel70_gcc83x_64/opt

`sudo dnf install cmake`

`sudo dnf install fmt-devel boost-devel spdlog-devel yaml-cpp-devel`

```

to get the packages I want:

```
sudo yum install fmt-devel boost-devel spdlog-devel yaml-cpp-devel
```

You must do the setup in this order:

`python -m venv ~/designs/dmc65v2/.venv/`

`source /env/bin/activate` then `scl enable devtoolset-8 bash` otherwise, the venv will clear the scl env.
`export PYBAG_PYTHON=/faust/user/kcaisley/designs/dmc65v2/.venv/bin/python`
`export OA_SRC_ROOT=/cadence/mentor/aoi_cal_2016.4_38.25/shared/pkgs/icv_oa/22.50p001`
`export OA_LINK_DIR=${OA_SRC_ROOT}/lib/linux_rhel50_gcc44x_64/opt`                        #notice these are build for rhel5, with gcc4
`export OA_INCLUDE_DIR=${OA_SRC_ROOT}/include`

`export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/faust/user/kcaisley/packages/spdlog-1.x/cmake:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}`
`export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/faust/user/kcaisley/packages/yaml-cpp-yaml-cpp-0.7.0:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}`

Fist we will need to following libraries:
* Boost
* fmt
* spdlog  > 1.x
* yaml-cpp

To make them accessible to the CMake tool, we first need to make sure they are on our system (and of the devel variety), and then add something to the beginning of the CMake path variable:
`export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=____:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}` where ___ is the thing you want to add

We are looking for the files of type:
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/fmt/fmt-config.cmake`

In this case, we would target the parent directory:
`export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/fmt:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}`

Okay, so this strategy of trying to use a bunch of manual downloads in not going to work...

Let's move to Fedora. Both the spdlog-devel and fmt-devel have their XXXConfig.cmake files right there.



# Trying again in Fedora:

inside /pybag, make sure you delete the `_build` folder, as it contains a cache of settings

NO, IT'S FINE, I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE ENV VAR PROPERLY SET. `build.sh` run script is uses deprecated commands, so we will need to launch `setup.py` manually

You must do the setup in this order:

`sudo dnf install cmake`

`sudo dnf install fmt-devel boost-devel spdlog-devel yaml-cpp-devel`

`sudo dnf install gcc_c++`

`sudo dnf install python3.10`       as h5py doesn't work on python 3.11 yet

`python3.10 -m venv ~/designs/dmc65v2/.venv`   as h5py doesn't work on python 3.11 yet

`python -m pip install wheel`

`source .venv/bin/activate`  to activate environment

`export PYBAG_PYTHON=/faust/user/kcaisley/designs/dmc65v2/.venv/bin/python`

`export OA_SRC_ROOT=/cadence/mentor/aoi_cal_2016.4_38.25/shared/pkgs/icv_oa/22.50p001`

`export OA_LINK_DIR=${OA_SRC_ROOT}/lib/linux_rhel50_gcc44x_64/opt`          #notice these are build for rhel5, with gcc4

`export OA_INCLUDE_DIR=${OA_SRC_ROOT}/include`

`export CXX=g++`      from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17275348/how-to-specify-new-gcc-path-for-cmake)

you make use `git clean -dfx`, that will remove all files not under source control. Be careful with this though, as it can delete newly created files if they haven't been added to source control yet.

this assumes an in-source build, of course, which is a bad habit

## Downgrading packages on Fedora:

### Error with {fmt} package during build

```
/usr/include/fmt/core.h:1757:7: error: static assertion failed: Cannot format an argument. To make type T formattable provide a formatter<T> specialization: https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#udt
```

Solution: It looks like other people have have [problems with fmt](https://gitlab.com/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix/-/issues/3366)

To downgrade to fmt 8.1, we can use the koji build system: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1927503

looks like the newest version of spdlog (1.11) supports fmt 9.1, and so we need to downgrade to spdlog 1.10 to support fmt 8.1.1.

here's the fmt/fmt-devel packages: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1927503
here's the spdlog/spdlog-devel packages: 

If a package is still in the repos, here's how you find and target it:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/266888/can-i-force-dnf-to-install-an-old-version-of-a-package

`dnf --showduplicates list <package>`

List packages that depend on the package of choice:
`dnf repoquery --installed --whatrequires qemu-kvm`

manually downgrade to a different package version downloaded from [this link](https://koji.fedoraproject.org)
`sudo dnf downgrade ~/Downloads/fmt-8.1.1-5.fc37.x86_64.rpm`


Had to remove gnome boxes, as it depends on fmt lib: `sudo dnf remove gnome-boxes`

`sudo dnf remove fmt fmt-devel spdlog spdlog-devel`  (march 02)

I knew I needed older version of spdlog to be compatible with my older fmt, based on [this](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/releases)

```
wget https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/fmt/8.1.1/4.fc37/x86_64/fmt-8.1.1-4.fc37.x86_64.rpm https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/fmt/8.1.1/4.fc37/x86_64/fmt-devel-8.1.1-4.fc37.x86_64.rpm https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/spdlog/1.10.0/1.fc37/x86_64/spdlog-1.10.0-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/spdlog/1.10.0/1.fc37/x86_64/spdlog-devel-1.10.0-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm -P ~/Downloads/
```

then simply manually install all of these rpms, assuming nothing else is in the download path
`sudo dnf install ~/Downloads/*.rpm`



### Error with Boost packages during build

```
/faust/user/kcaisley/designs/dmc65v2/bag/pybag/cbag/src/cbag/spirit/range.cpp:53:1:   required from here
/usr/include/boost/spirit/home/x3/operator/detail/sequence.hpp:144:25: error: static assertion failed: Size of the passed attribute is bigger than expected.
  144 |             actual_size <= expected_size
      |             ~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Let's try downgrading Boost and Boost devel:

```
> sudo dnf remove boost boost-devel

> wget https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/boost/1.76.0/10.fc37/x86_64/boost-1.76.0-10.fc37.x86_64.rpm https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/boost/1.76.0/10.fc37/x86_64/boost-devel-1.76.0-10.fc37.x86_64.rpm -P ~/Downloads/
```

Now I can't just manually install these now, because a couple core system components, namely `gnome-shell` require other boost libraries, like `boost-system` which an older version of `boost` wouldn't be compatible with.

# fmt and spdlog

fmt is a formatting library which provides a standardized, safe, fast way to construct strings. This is useful for output messages and dynamically generating filepaths in C++ code.

spdlog, pronounced 'speed log', is a library built on top of {fmt} which allows for the

# January 12: picking back up work

My current status ilss that I need to compile and install pybag, which depends on a bunch of different packages. Building the cbag subrepo though requires `fmt`, `spdlog`, and a collection of `boost` libs. The specific versions needed can't be accessed easily via the Fedora fedora dnf repos, and so I fear I'll just need to manually download and build the projects from source.

First, let's examine what we currently have installed, and specify exactly what we need to download.

# January 20: continuing with development

I think looking at how `cbag` and `cbag_polygon` are built first might be helpful in this case.

One must understand that CMake is a build system, in that it simple generates build files which are then compiles with a system's native build environment.

Running just the CMake build command gives me several clues:

In the CMakeLists.txt file, I see a control flow statement for:
`if(DEFINED ENV{OA_LINK_DIR})`

I've check it, and it's not evaluating, the else() statment below is instead.

#### Workflow:
```
[kcaisley@asiclab008 ~]$ cd designs/dmc65v2/
[kcaisley@asiclab008 dmc65v2]$ source setup.sh        
(.venv) [kcaisley@asiclab008 dmc65v2]$ cd bag/pybag/cbag/
(.venv) [kcaisley@asiclab008 cbag]$ rm -r _build
(.venv) [kcaisley@asiclab008 cbag]$ export BUILD_TYPE=${1:-Debug}
(.venv) [kcaisley@asiclab008 cbag]$ cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=${BUILD_TYPE} -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache
```
Where
`-H` This internal option is not documented but widely used by community and Has been replaced in 3.13 with the official source directory flag of -S.
    there is no space place after for the directory, so the . is the local location
`-B` Starting with CMake 3.13, -B is an officially supported flag, can handle spaces correctly and can be used independently of the -S or -H options.
    again, there should be nospace, so `_build` is the build directory name
    
`-D` -D <var>:<type>=<value>
       Create a cmake cache entry.

       When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates  it
       with  customizable  settings  for  the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting that
       takes priority over the project's default value.  The option may be repeated  for  as  many  cache
       entries as desired.
     Again, no space! There are hundreds of options in this file, but this comman above is specifically setting:
     CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE which is being set to 'Debug'
     CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER which passes the 'ccache' option to the makefiles generator, no idea relaly that this does
`|| exit` suffix should be removed, as this is being run on the command line, and this will cause the terminal to exit if the command fails

Now I just need to understand why the WARNING: building without OpenAccess support. path is running.....

I think the issue is that there is some complexity to CMake variable/environment variable scope system.

Yes, this is the issues. Those unix bash environment variables are not visible inside the CMake scope. Let's figure out how this can be set.

It's not being passed down from higher level CMake script, so it must be in the way that the command to build is called.

cmake -H. -B_build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=${BUILD_TYPE} -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache -DOA_LINK_DIR=/cadence/mentor/aoi_cal_2016.4_38.25/shared/pkgs/icv_oa/22.50p001/lib/linux_rhel50_gcc44x_64/opt

The CMakeCache.txt File

After the first configuration of a project, CMake persists variable information in a text file called CMakeCache.txt. Caches are used to improve. When CMake is re-run on a project the cache is read before starting so that some re-parsing time can be saved on CMakeLists.txt. Here is where passing parameters to CMake befuddles a beginner. If a variable is passed via the command line that variable is stored in the cache. Accessing that variable on future runs of CMake will always get the value stored inside the cache and new value passed through the command line are ignored. To make CMake take the new value passed through the command line the first value have to be explicitly undefined. Like so:

`cmake -U <previously defined variable> -D <previously defined variable>[=new value]`

(A better approach is to use CMake internal variables. For more information refer the CMake manual here.)

The syntax `if(DEFINED <name>|CACHE{<name>}|ENV{<name>})` is true if a variable, cache variable or environment variable with given <name> is defined. The value of the variable does not matter.


Environment Variables are like ordinary Variables, with the following differences:
* Environment variables have global scope in a CMake process. They are never cached.
* Variable References have the form $ENV{<variable>}, using the ENV operator.
* Initial values of the CMake environment variables are those of the calling process. Values can be changed using the set() and unset() commands. These commands only affect the running CMake process, not the system environment at large. Changed values are not written back to the calling process, and they are not seen by subsequent build or test processes.
* See the cmake -E env command-line tool to run a command in a modified environment.
* Source: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#cmake-language-environment-variables

This isn't working because I'm setting regular variables, but the check is for an environment variable.


Ohhhhh. If you set an vairable, just by writing it, it will only be valid in that shell. It's called a variable. If you write 'export' first though, it's now and 'environment variable' and will be active in all child processes.

Now, if it's inside a script (which is run as a child process), and if you want to access it inside another child process, you need to make sure that first you 'source' the script, so that the contents of the script re available in the parent bash session, but then you also need to add the 'export' command, if you want it to be available in a child pocess like CMake.
So in short the 'source' command makes bash script which would otherwise be child process, instead run in the parent bash session.
And 'export' makes all variables defined in the parent process also defined in the child processes.

When including files, if it's just a simple world like `#include <tuple>`, then this is probably a C++ standard lib component. If it is formatted like `#include <boost/geometry.hpp>`, then this is a good clue that the library isn't standard due to the .hpp suffix, and also that the libary is written in C++. If you have one like `#include <limits.h>`, we know this is written in C, and there is a good chance this is actually part of the C standard library, which is included in the C++ std lib but is deprecated and not advisable to use.

The fix was including the `<limits>` standard library header in the offending file, so that `std::numeric_limits` is defined. One thing I learned from the above error log is that we can see the trace of imports that lead to the offending file. We tried to compile `src/cbag/common/box_collection.cpp` but the error was in `cbag/include/cbag/common/typedefs.h`. We we read the "build line first", then the "In file included from" bottom to top", then finally the lowest section with the "error" to find our problem. In this case, our solution was adding a single line:

NOTE: I believe that `<cstdint>` defines primitive types like `int32_t`. Like the other std lib headers, `gcc` stores them at `/usr/include/c++/12`

```

The solution is described right there in the message, we forgot `std::optional` is defined in header `<optional>`; yep we forget to `#include <optional>` in `cbag/include/cbag/layout/lp_lookup.h`.

```

I think a similar problem is seen here: https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3034

Seems I need to made a change to the function call, to meet this latest issue: https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#udt

I simply commented out the line:
`throw std::invalid_argument(fmt::format("path segment vector {} not valid", p_norm));`

And it proceeded until 52% compilation


and finally an unused fix.....

How I bulit containers to test the other versions of EL:

# Container Creation
sudo dnf install apptainer
apptainer build --sandbox cbag_centos7.sif docker://centos:7
apptainer shell --fakeroot --writable cbag_centos7.sif/

# For Centos7:
yum -y update && yum clean all
yum install centos-release-scl
yum install devtoolset-8
yum install epel-release
yum install which yaml-cpp yaml-cpp-devel fmt fmt-devel spdlog spdlog-devel cmake3 //note cmake3
source /opt/rh/devtoolset-8/enable

cd to folder and export CC and CXX
tried to build, but didn't work as spdlog wasn't new enough to include .cmake files

# For RockyLinux 8.7:
dnf -y update && dnf clean all
dnf install epel-release
dnf install which yaml-cpp yaml-cpp-devel fmt fmt-devel spdlog spdlog-devel cmake gcc gcc-c++ boost boost-devel

starts compiling after stting static boost to OFF, but then fails at compiling with boost...

# For RockyLinux 9.1:
dnf -y update && dnf clean all
dnf -y install epel-release
dnf -y install which yaml-cpp yaml-cpp-devel fmt fmt-devel spdlog spdlog-devel cmake gcc gcc-c++ boost boost-devel

same errors as fedora 37

# Email to Ayan:

If you have a moment, would it be possible for you to check what versions of gcc
and CMake are used to compile your copy of the CBAG submodule, and what versions
of the Boost, fmt, spdlog, and yaml-cpp libraries it is built against?

I have tried the following combinations of packages versions across various
distributions:

Distro      gcc/g++ CMake   Boost   fmt     spdlog  yaml-cpp
CentOS      7.9     8.3.1   3.17.0  1.53    6.2.1   0.10.0 0.5.1  (devtoolset-8)
RHEL        8.7     8.5.0   3.20.2  1.66    6.3.1   1.5.0 0.6.2
RHEL        9.1     11.3.1  3.20.2  1.75    8.1.1   1.10.0 0.6.3
Fedora 37   12.2.1  3.25.2  1.78    9.1.0   1.10.0  0.6.3
Fedora 37   12.2.1  3.25.2  1.81    9.1.0   1.11.0  0.6.3

In each case I have linked my copies of the OA binaies, have worked through
successfully generating make/build files with CMake, and compilation begins. But
in each case there are numerous compilation errors, primarily in the form of
static assertion failures originating from the fmt and Boost libraries. I've
made the most progress in the latter Fedora 37 configuration by editing the CBAG
source to be compatible with fmt >9.0, but am still stuck on a couple of the
more cryptic errors.

fmt     spdlog      yaml-cpp
8.1.1   1.10.0      0.6.3

So I think I'll just:

To use the std::out_of_range function in C++ code, you need to include the <stdexcept> header file in your code.

`#include <stdexcept>` in include/cbag/util/sorted_vector.h

cmake -H. -B_build -DHUNTER_STATUS_DEBUG=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

cmake --build _build



Make sure, when installing from python top level build.sh, you need to have 'sudo dnf install python3.10 python3.10-devel`

## 22 March

I'd like to understand a number of concepts related to my Python/Pybind/CMake/C++ environment:

Duck typing
generics
    in C++ but not Python, due to it's typing
    in C++ done with templates
    avoids the need for function overloading


other C++ features that were added later:
garbage collector
shared pointer
metaprogramming
detailing

# CMake workflow:

First, download and bootstrap vcpkg itself; it can be installed anywhere, but generally we recommend using vcpkg as a submodule for CMake projects.

$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
$ ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

To install the libraries for your project, run:

$ ./vcpkg/vcpkg install [packages to install]

You can also search for the libraries you need with the search subcommand:

$ ./vcpkg/vcpkg search [search term]

In order to use vcpkg with CMake, you can use the toolchain file:

$ cmake -B [build directory] -S . "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
$ cmake --build [build directory]




# Visual Studio Code with CMake Tools 
Adding the following to your workspace settings.json will make CMake Tools automatically use vcpkg for libraries:

{
  "cmake.configureSettings": {
    "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE": "[vcpkg root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
  }
}


# To enable versioning when running vcpkg
./vcpkg/vcpkg --feature-flags="versions" install

I should test this from just the cbag directory:

```
cmake -B_build -S. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/home/kcaisley/packages/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```


Step 1: Clone the vcpkg repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
```

Make sure you are in the directory you want the tool installed to before doing this.

Step 2: Run the bootstrap script to build vcpkg

```
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

## Notes about building cbag with vcpkg

the errors with not finding compilers and make program only happen when running


fatal: path 'versions/baseline.json' exists on disk, but not in '664f8bb619b752430368d0f30a8289b761f5caba'

You can use the current commit as a baseline, which is:
        "builtin-baseline": "c9f906558f9bb12ee9811d6edc98ec9255c6cda5"
        
Adding the following before `project(cbag)`

```
set(CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM /usr/bin/make)
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER /usr/bin/gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER /usr/bin/g++)
```

Okay, that fixed it. Now the only error I'm seeing is:

```
error: Cannot resolve a minimum constraint for dependency boost-disjoint-sets from boost:x64-linux.
The dependency was not found in the baseline, indicating that the package did not exist at that time. This may be fixed by providing an explicit override version via the "overrides" field or by updating the baseline.
See `vcpkg help versioning` for more information.
```

These are the 
[two](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/take-control-of-your-vcpkg-dependencies-with-versioning-support/)
[links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/versioning.concepts)
needed for me to proceed in solving this error. Also, see `../../vcpkg/vcpkg help versioning`


This is how a manifest file should work:


{
    "name": "example",
    "version": "1.0",
    "builtin-baseline": "a14a6bcb27287e3ec138dba1b948a0cdbc337a3a",
    "dependencies": [
        { "name": "zlib", "version>=": "1.2.11#8" },
        "rapidjson"
    ],
    "overrides": [
        { "name": "rapidjson", "version": "2020-09-14" }
    ]
}



The boost components I probably need are:

container
container-hash
fusion
units
mpl
tokenizer
units
spirit



serialization (compiled, contains container_hash, and archive libraries)

spirit (header-only)
fusion
units
mpl
tokenizer


I give up for now. I can't install Boost with vcpkg. It's too frustrating. Boost 1.75 is the oldest I can install with a built-in baseline, and for some reason manually specifying the baseline with overrides requires me to write out each of the packages in Boost.


## Building on April 10
cp -r /cadence/mentor/aoi_cal_2016.4_38.25/shared/pkgs/icv_oa.aoi/22.50p001/ .

find . -type d -name "*example*"


This is the location of the binaries I want:
/mnt/md127/tools/mentor/aoi_cal_2016.4_38.25/shared/pkgs/icv_oa.aoi/22.50p001

So, assuming it is mounted on my machine at `/cadence`, I can do:

```
cp -r /cadence/mentor/aoi_cal_2016.4_38.25/shared/pkgs/icv_oa.aoi/22.50p001/* .
```


## Multiple defenitions errors:

I'm finding some possible recommendations about how to figure out this multiple definitions issue:


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69326932/multiple-definition-errors-during-gcc-linking-in-linux
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37525922/how-to-handle-gcc-link-optionslike-whole-archive-allow-multiple-definition

The idea to hack it with `--allow-multiple-definition` in `target_link_libraries` doesn't work as `g++` doesn't support it.
