# Lesson: A taxonomy of Electronics

I’d like to break down and categorize the ways in which we think about circuits. I want to provide a bit of historical context (mechanical switches, vacumm tubes, older transistors, and BJTs) and a bit of introduction to the fact that MEMS, microfluidics, integrated optics, integrated magnetics, antennas, photodiodes, and detectors, bio sensors, all exist as well. Pretty much any thing you can image can be ‘integrated’ on a chip. But for todays discussions we are going to restrict ourselves to devices that can easily be integrated on a chip.

Transistors, resistors, capacitors, and inductors (sparingly, as they are large).

## How are these devices used?
