Things are starting to come together for BAG, but I do feel anxious it will be endless. I need to list some facts out, to get my mind right.

* 28nm designs are mandatory for now
* my designs must have .OA cellviews as an output? Actually not so sure about this one.
* But at the least, they designs should be examinable in Cadence Virtuoso
* 28nm TSMC PDK apperently is difficult when porting schematic Pcells?
