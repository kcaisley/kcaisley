Maxwell's equations
	In free space
Fields in media/interfaces/
	Coupled mode theory
	anisotropic media
	isotropic media
boundary conditions
	snell's law
	brewster's angle
The wave equation
	Plane wave solutions
	Helmholtz equation
energy and power of waves
Wave polarization
	perpedicular, parallel, circularly
Reflections from media interfaces
Reciprocity and Image Theory (Method of images)
TE,TM, and TEM modes (somehow related to 'gaussian beams?'
Waveguides
	Perturbation Theory (Used to find attenuation)
Resonance
	Cavity resonators (used in both optical and microwave)
Coherence



propogation of EM waves in vacuum/free space and matter
reflection,refraction, and dispersion

Optics: interference, diffraction,polarization
Gaussian beam  propogation, optical resonators, atom/light interactions
