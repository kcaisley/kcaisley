I have a privelage of doing a PhD in this field, I should take advantage of it while I'm here.
- only cover topics:
	- that are basis of my thesis/research
	- which I will teach in class
	- which I will be questioned about at my defense
	- or at a conference
- try to center around Jochen's or Han's field
	- as it is very hard to learn outside my groups discipline.
- keep knowledge at a whiteboard or prototyping level of complexity
	- anything more complex is out of scope, and is probably research
* build from:
	* conversations, textbooks, papers, lectures, 
* DO: include problems adapted into mini-examples
* DO: build around my central field of resaerch
* DO: include anything I ideally would like to be able to 'whiteboard'


I will build out the analog/mixed-signal design portions with problems, from lecture notes, in tandem with doing PLL design.
