* Archeology: Understanding previous research efforts. How well did they perform?
* Benchmarking: Framework for comparing via a figure-of-merit. Accounting for pitch, power, area, resolution, Compare previous designs.
* Mathematical Analysis: What is an optimal (highest FOM) signal processing system, given a pulse input signal, desired extracted output data, certain process, and engineering constraints (stuff outside FOM).
* Apply this knowledge to find a unexplored gap in designs, and postulate what 

# Service Work
* IT infrastructure: mostly done, just needing documentation and clean up
* Educational material: Circuit design, or signal processing for pixel chips. A good class would probably be using HDL21 to draw visual schematics, and then create a basic signal processing chain. Perhaps compile against SKY130 technology. This wouldn't require any licenses, or special software.
