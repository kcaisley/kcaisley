As far as IDE features go, there are some features I should be able to access in Vim, like:

* syntax highlighting,
* tab completion
* hooks (for executing builds/scripts)
* variable introspection
* doc strings
* inline file browsing and switching
* fuzzy finding
* project wide searching
* multi-language linting/error checking
* type checking
* quick terminal execution without exiting the editor
* jump to definition (which I can do with Ctags)
* code formatting plugins
* auto-brackets


meld is great for diffing



## OS interaction features in python:

* subprocess module, with methods subprocess.run() and subprocess.open()

* command library from PyPI: 3rd party so don't want to use it
* os module: deprecated
