I read a [blog](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/declarative-configuration-management/) about configration management and it explained that Kubernetes strictly defines the layer for defining state of libraries, the intermediate streaming layer which is protocol buffers, and the layer which implements the config on the actual system. This is useful because the decoupling allows a user to use whatever language they prefer and easily refactor/verify the library state generation code. 

Because the constructs of a language are often super well equipped to deal with parameterization and abstraction, you can take full advantage of a language to generate in clever ways.

This same paradigm exists in circuits. We have clearly define inputs and outputs in the various phases of the circuits. We would benefit from standadizing the interfaces of these stages so that we can more easily interchange between them.
