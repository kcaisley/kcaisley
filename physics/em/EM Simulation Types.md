[This site](https://www.matecdev.com/posts/differences-fdtd-fem-mom.html) has information about the three basic numerical approaches for electromagnetic simulation, namely:

* Finite-differences-time domain (FDTD)
* Finite Element Method (FEM), like Elmer
* Method of Moments (MoM), or equivalently, Boundary Element Method (BEM)

It also documents the available solver types.
