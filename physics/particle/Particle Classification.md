Notes: 
- Leptons/antileptons have no strong interaction
- 
Order of detection:
1. Charged Hadrons (Proton, Pion, etc) and charged Leptons (Electron, Muon, and Tau) are detected in silicon tracker. BUT: Neutral Hadrons (Neutrons, etc) and Neutral Leptons (All three Neutrino) and photons are not detected in silicon tracker as they uncharged
2. Photons and electrons are stopped in electromagnetic calorimeter, protons aren't stopped but are 'visible'.
3. Charged and neutral hadrons are stopped in hadron calorimeter
4. Muons are stopped in the muon outer layers. Neutrinos of all three types pass through with no interaction

**Composite Particles**
Hadrons (Made of Quarks, almost always unstable when 'free')
- Baryons (Odd quarks, usually 3)
	- Protons
	- Neutrons
	- +Exotic Baryons
- Mesons- Even quarks, usually 2, stable only ns before decay
	- Pions
	- Kaons
