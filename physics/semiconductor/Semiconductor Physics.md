This studied the electric, thermal, and quantum effects of carriers and electromagnetic fields in lattices of crystall solids. It extends beyond semiconductors, of course, as both insulators and conductors exist here too, so the label is a bit of a misnomer.

The scope is wave functions to juctions. At the top end, this is:

* mos  metal isn’t usually used thoPolysilicon gates can bear high temperatures while metal gates can melt over that same temperature, so we can use the polysilicon gates as a self-alignment gate process during the fabrication of CMOS. There’s no current flow, but the electric field can still modilate the bend across the oxide. Flat band, accumulation (e in n type), depletion (space charge), inversion (holes in N) states 

* pn

* ms junction. schottky barrier vs ohmic state. called a ohmic contact if metal workfunction is less than SC workfunciton
* pin (or ptype-oxide-ntype)

One important link, after studying devices in a vaccum, is to study them under radiation from incident particles, i.e. [[Particle-Matter Interaction]]
