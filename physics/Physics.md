The scope of these pages is all the underlying physical effects, including radiation, particle, quantum physics, semiconductor physics, heating, mechanical stress, etc that I need to understand in order to do my job. Mostly this will be a baseline of intution, figures of reference, and

## Physics
Before considering my field, I must consider the wide range of models used to explain the “why” of electronics and particles. These are two low level to be tractable for design, but are important for my intuition and reasoning.
