tempus static timing analysis (singoff/QRC), 
voltus (voltage drop analysis)

1. stack at fold, push pattern expect ebahvior,

2. transient test, push the pattern, epxect some output,

3. iddq test no leakage test
4. Schmot plot (not production, just validation test)

produciont you 

validation is just with test unit, production is at mast producction.

like thermal cycles, for validation only

wafer test to make sure it works, then passing 

bridging test
