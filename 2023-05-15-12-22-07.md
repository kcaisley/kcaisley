# junctions

mos  metal isnâ€™t usually used thoPolysilicon gates can bear high temperatures while metal gates can melt over that same temperature, so we can use the polysilicon gates as a self-alignment gate process during the fabrication of CMOS.

ms junction  (schottky barrier), called a ohmic contact if metal wf is less than SC wf
