# junctions

mos  metal isn’t usually used thoPolysilicon gates can bear high temperatures while metal gates can melt over that same temperature, so we can use the polysilicon gates as a self-alignment gate process during the fabrication of CMOS.
There’s no current flow, but the electric field can still modilate the bend across the oxide
Flat band, accumulation (e in n type), depletion (space charge), inversion (holes in N) states 


pn


ms junction. schottky barrier vs ohmic state. called a ohmic contact if metal wf is less than SC wf

pin


bjt  bipolar because there are teo currenet.


fet. Mosfet or jfet. Unipolar.
