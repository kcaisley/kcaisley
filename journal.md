These past two months have been overwhelming, as I find myself totally unable to function due to my overwhelming desire to optomize my technological life, but at the same time wish I wasn't thinking about it at all. I have found some solace in the command line, however. On the command line, I feel as though I have control. I feel as though I can access the internet on my own physcological terms. When I work and write in a browser, having access to the internet being something difficult and automated works boons for my anxiety. I finally feel like I own my physche when working in this text only interface.

If I don't have any apps on my iphone, and if I don't keep any data on my phone, then it no longer retains the status of holding my "entire life". I won't keep passwords, or notes, or audio files on the phone. It can be reset, lost, or any manner of other personalization. While I do dream of somehow switching to a device that can allow me to completely remove my dependency smartphones, I fear that may just become a black hole of tweaking and customization and deep diving. I want to get outside, to see the sunshine, and to stop using technology as much.

I can start by getting rid of my Mac. It's not necessary in any capacity. I also think that if possible, it would be good for my wifi to go. I spent a lot of time traveling, and so I end up paying for something I don't use anyways. I can then just keep my cell phone plan at 8 EUR per months and go from there.

What about my account passwords and user data? When I travel, I can take my Airbnb/Bewelcome, Posteo email, and Bank Account password. Other than that, I don't think I should bring anything. All of my personal file, passwords, and archived documents can then be stored on a pair on thumb drives, which can then be stored along with all of my paper documents. These documents can be cleaned up on a regular interval, by loading them into a linux computer. I can use Git to store recovery data, incase I accidentally delete a file.

What I like about Fedora is that it's not a blank slate. It's a flexible and customizable OS, but with a opiniated set of defaults the closely track the modern state of the art. I can easily modify it when necessary, but it gives me as a base a set of defaults that are sane and which teach me. I have to "know the rules, before I can break them".
