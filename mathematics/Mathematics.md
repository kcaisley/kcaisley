My primary goal in understanding math is to provide an template for reusable models, optimizations, frameworks, etc. I'm focused on applied math here.

I should delve deeply enough to understand the math I see in my electronics, devices, and physics books. The focus is on my understanding and being able to speak and think in this language.

[[Calculus and Differential Equations]]

[[Statistics, Probability, and Randomness]]

[[Linear Algebra]]

[[Optimization]]
