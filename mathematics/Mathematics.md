## Math
Math is the pure study of numbers, symbols, spaces, and geometries. We can apply it for the construction of models, as well as the optimization of systems described and explained by those models. The relevant fields are 
- calculus (vector, multivariable, sequences and series)
- differential equations (ordinary and PDEs, Fourier series is solving 2nd order ODE, basic theory of Fourier series is infinite dimensional vector spaces)
-Â linear algebra (vector spaces)

My primary goal in understanding math is to provide an template for reusable models, optimizations, frameworks, etc. I'm focused on applied math here.

I should delve deeply enough to understand the math I see in my electronics, devices, and physics books. The focus is on my understanding and being able to speak and think in this language.
