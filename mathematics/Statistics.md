## Statistics
Concerning the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. The opposite of mechanistic modeling. Used to learn, describe, and predict the behavior of systems after empirical data has been collected. 

Statistical or correlation studies often bypass the need for causality and focus exclusively on prediction, and not mechanistic explanations of “why?”.

As most data is computer generated (Ninety per cent of the world's data have been generated in the last 5 years), these methods are often closely intertwined with computer algorithms.

## Permutations, combinations?


Permutations and combinations, allow us to work with simple discrete known populations and directly calculate probability from it.

Random variables

Intersections and unions of sets

Multiplication rule
Bayes’ theorem, the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers, covariance and correlation, and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

Probability density functions and cumulative design functions
